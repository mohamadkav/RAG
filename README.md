# Step-by-Step Implementation of the RAG Framework

This guide outlines the process of implementing a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework to efficiently leverage documentation for configuration and troubleshooting.

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Collect the Required Documentation
Begin by gathering the necessary documentation to build the RAG knowledge base. For example:  
[Kubernetes Nginx Annotations Documentation](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/blob/main/docs/user-guide/nginx-configuration/annotations.md).

---

### 2. Organize Documentation into Sections
- Review and parse the documentation to break it into meaningful "sections."
- Each section should correspond to a specific topic or context to facilitate structured querying.

---

### 3. Generate a Documentation Array
- Use Python (or your preferred programming language) to parse the structured sections into an array or list format.
- Ensure each entry in the array corresponds to a section of the documentation for efficient retrieval.

---

### 4. Integrate User Queries with the RAG Database
- Accept user queries as input to the RAG system.
- Retrieve relevant documentation sections from the database to use as the baseline for generating a response.

---

### 5. Design Prompts for the RAG Model
Craft clear prompts to guide the RAG system's responses. Example prompt structure:
```text
Context: These are the extracted documentation sections: <extracted documentation>
Request: Based on this, provide the necessary output (e.g., YAML file or CLI commands) to resolve my issue.
Instruction: Check the provided context and only include necessary configuration items. Hereâ€™s the user query: <user query>
```

### Step 6: Validate Results Against Ground Truth

To ensure the RAG system's output is effective, compare the generated results against reference answers (e.g., solutions from forums or validated documentation). Follow these steps:

1. **Compare Output to Ground Truth**
   - Match the generated output with the correct solution to determine its accuracy.

2. **Classify the Results**
   - **Fully Fixed:** The output is accurate, resolves the issue entirely, and matches the reference solution.
   - **Partially Fixed:** The output addresses the issue but contains some flaws. Classify the specific type of issue:
     - **Type I:** Fixed but includes unnecessary configuration items.
     - **Type II:** Fixed but missing required configuration items.
     - **Type III:** Fixed but contains incorrect arguments or values.
   - **Not Fixed:** The output fails to address the issue or is irrelevant.

3. **Document the Evaluation**
   - Record the type of result (e.g., Fully Fixed, Partially Fixed - Type I, etc.).
   - Note any observations about why the result succeeded or failed.

4. **Iterate for Improvement**
   - Use insights from the evaluation to refine the documentation structure, prompt design, or RAG system logic.

By validating results systematically, this step ensures continuous improvement in the RAG framework's performance and reliability.
